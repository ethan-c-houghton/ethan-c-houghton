👋 I'm Ethan, a passionate Linux engineer working at Nclose, a leading cybersecurity company in South Africa. I'm 21 years old and on a mission to climb up the ranks and provide value to others by learning, completing certifications, and ultimately making an impact in the tech world.

### About Me
- 🧠 Strength: I can focus for long periods, which aids me in tackling complex technical problems.
- 😅 Weakness: I tend to try to do too many things at once; working on that!

### Professional Goals
- 🚀 Short-term: Getting promoted as quickly as possible (as a result of dedication and hard work).
- 🌐 Long-term: Creating my own company and launching a business incubator organization, taking care of the automation and security for selected companies.

### Skills (Currently being worked on)
- Linux
- Networking
- Technical Writing
- Cybersecurity
